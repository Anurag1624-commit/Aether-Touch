# Aether-Touch
Aether-Touch is a real-time hand gesture recognition system built using Media_Pipe and OpenCV. By leveraging computer vision and neural networks for hand landmark detection, this project enables seamless, touchless interaction with system hardware—specifically controlling system volume through intuitive finger-pinch movements.
